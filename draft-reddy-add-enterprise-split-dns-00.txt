1.  Introduction

   [RFC7626] discusses DNS privacy considerations in both "on the wire"
   (Section 2.4 of [RFC7626]) and "in the server" (Section 2.5 of
   [RFC7626]) contexts.  Also, there has been an increase in the
   availability of "public resolvers" [RFC8499] which DNS clients may be
   perconfigured to use instead of the default network resolver for a
   variety of reasons (e.g., offer a good reachability, support an
   encrypted transport, provide a claimed privacy policy, (lack of)
   filtering).

   If public encrypted DNS servers (e.g., DNS-over-TLS (DoT) [RFC7858]
   or DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) [RFC8484]) are used instead of using local
   DNS servers, it can adversely impact Enterprise network-based
   security features.  Indeed, various network security services are
   provided by Enterprise networks to protect endpoints (e.g., laptops,
   printers, IoT devices) and to enforce enterprise-specific policies.
   These policies may be necessary to protect employees, customers, or
   enterprise network.  It is out of the scope of this memo to
   characterize such policies nor assess that they used to achieved the
   claimed intent.  Nevertheless, Enterprise DNS servers in place for
   these purposes act on DNS messages involving endpoints connected to
   the Enterprise network to enforce these policies.  Therefore, if an
   endpoint uses a public encrypted DNS server, the desired enterprise
   protection level and enforcement will be bypassed and thus nullified.

   In order to act on DNS messages involving endpoints connected to an
   Enterprise network, network security services can be configured to
   block DoT traffic by dropping outgoing packets to destination port
   number 853.  Identifying DoH traffic is far more challenging than DoT
   traffic.  Network security services may try to identify the well-
   known DoH resolvers by their domain name and DoH traffic can be
   blocked by dropping outgoing packets to these domains.  However, DoH
   traffic can not be fully identified without acting as a TLS proxy.

   If a network security service blocks access to a public encrypted DNS
   server, there are incompatibilities with the privacy profiles
   discussed in [RFC8310]:

   o  If an endpoint has enabled strict privacy profile (Section 5 of
      [RFC8310]), the endpoint cannot resolve DNS names.

   o  If an endpoint has enabled opportunistic privacy profile
      (Section 5 of [RFC8310]), the endpoint will either fallback to an
      encrypted connection without authenticating the DNS server
      provided by the local network or fallback to clear text DNS, and
      cannot exchange encrypted DNS messages.

      The fallback adversely impacts security and privacy as internal
      attacks are possible within Enterprise networks.  For example, an
      internal attacker can modify the DNS responses to re-direct a
      client to malicious servers or pervasively monitor the DNS
      traffic.  The reader may refer to Section 3.2.1 of
      [I-D.arkko-farrell-arch-model-t] for a discussion on the need for
      more awareness about attacks from within closed domains.

   To overcome the above threats, this document specifies a mechanism to
   convey internal-only DNS names to endpoints connected to an
   Enterprise network and to determine if the Enterprise networks allows
   split-horizon DNS.  DNS clients can discover and authenticate
   encrypted DNS servers provided by the Enterprise network, for example
   using the techniques proposed in [I-D.btw-add-home] and
   [I-D.pauly-add-deer].  Discovery of encrypted DNS server for roamed
   enterprise endpoints is discussed in [I-D.btw-add-ipsecme-ike] (see
   Section 8).

   Provisioning Domains (PvDs) are defined in [RFC7556] as sets of
   network configuration information.  [RFC8801] defines a mechanism for
   discovering multiple Explicit PvDs on a single network and their
   Additional Information by means of an HTTP-over-TLS query using an
   URI derived from the PvD ID.  This document defines two PvD Keys:

   The InternalDNSDomains PvD Key:  which is used to convey that the
      specified DNS domains must be resolved using the Enterprise DNS
      server

   The SplitDNSAllowed PvD Key:  which is used to determine if the
      Enterprise network allows split-horizon DNS.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8499].

   'Encrypted DNS' refers to a DNS protocol that provides an encrypted
   channel between a DNS client and server (e.g., DoT, DoH, or DoQ).

   DNS resolution servers accessible only to devices attached to the
   Enterprise network will be referred to as "Internal DNS servers";
   other DNS servers will be referred to as "external DNS servers".

3.  Scope of the Document

   If a device is managed by an enterprise's IT department, the device
   can be configured to use Enterprise-provided encrypted DNS servers.
   This configuration may be manual or rely upon whatever deployed
   device management tool in an Enterprise network.  For example,
   customizing Firefox using Group Policy to use the Enterprise DoH
   server is discussed in [Firefox-Policy] for Windows and MacOS, and
   setting Chrome policies is discussed in [Chrome-Policy] and
   [Chrome-DoH].

   If mobile device management (MDM) (e.g., [MDM-Apple]) is used to
   secure BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), MDM can be used to configure OS/
   browser with the Enterprise provided DoH/DoT server.  If an endpoint
   is on-boarded, for example, using Over-The-Air (OTA) enrollment [OTA]
   to provision the device with a certificate and configuration profile,
   the configuration profile can include the authentication domain name
   (ADN) of the encrypted DNS server.  The OS/Browser can use the
   configuration profile to use the Enterprise provided encrypted DNS
   server.  In this case, MDM is not installed on the device.

   Provisioning IT-managed devices, BYOD devices with MDM or
   configuration profile with the Split DNS configuration is out side
   the scope of this document.

Internet-Draft   Split DNS config in Enterprise Networks   February 2021


   Typically, Enterprise networks do not assume that all devices in
   their network are managed by the IT team or MDM, especially in the
   quite common BYOD scenario.  The endpoint can use the discovered
   Enterprise Encrypted DNS server to only access internal-only DNS
   names and use another public DNS server for public domains or use the
   discovered Enterprise Encrypted DNS server to access both internal-
   only DNS names and public domains.

   The scope of this document is restricted to unmanaged BYOD devices
   without a configuration profile.  The unmanaged BYOD devices use the
   credentials (user name and password) provided by the IT admin to
   mutually authenticate to the Enterprise WLAN Access Point (e.g.,
   PEAP-MSCHAPv2 [PEAP], EAP-pwd [RFC8146], EAP-PSK [RFC4764]).

   Note:   Many users have privacy and personal data sovereignty
      concerns with employers installing MDM on their personal devices;
      they are concerned that admin can glean personal information and
      could control how they use their devices.  When users do not
      install MDM on their devices, IT admins do not get visibility into
      the security posture of those devices.  To overcome this problem,
      a host agent can cryptographically attest the security status
      associated with device, such as minimum pass code length,
      biometric login enabled, OS version etc.  This approach is fast
      gaining traction especially with the advent of closed OS like
      Windows 10 in S mode [win10s] or Chromebook [Chromebook], where
      applications are sandboxed (e.g., ransomware attack is not
      possible) and applications can only be installed via the OS store.

4.  Split DNS

   [RFC2826] "does not preclude private networks from operating their
   own private name spaces" but notes that if private networks "wish to
   make use of names uniquely defined for the global Internet, they have
   to fetch that information from the global DNS naming hierarchy".

   There are various DNS deployments outside of the global public DNS,
   including "split horizon" deployments and DNS usages on private (or
   virtual private) networks.  In a split horizon, an authoritative
   server gives different responses to queries from the Internet than
   they do to internal DNS servers; while some deployments differentiate
   internal queries from public queries by the source IP address, the
   concerns in Section 3.1.1 of [RFC6950] relating to trusting source IP
   addresses apply to such deployments.

   When the internal address space range is private [RFC1918], this
   makes it both easier for the server to discriminate public from
   private and harder for public entities to impersonate nodes in the
   private network.  The use cases that motivate split-horizon DNS

   typically involve restricting access to some network services --
   intranet resources such as internal web sites, development servers,
   or directories, for example -- while preserving the ease of use
   offered by domain names for internal users.

   An Enterprise can require one or more DNS domains to be resolved via
   internal DNS servers.  This can be a special domain, such as
   "corp.example.com" for an enterprise that is publicly known to use
   "example.com".  In this case, the endpoint needs to be informed what
   the internal-only domain names are and what the IP addresses of the
   internal DNS servers are.  An enterprise can also run a different
   version of its public domain on its internal network.  In that case,
   the client is instructed to send DNS queries for the enterprise
   public domain (e.g., "example.com") to the internal DNS servers.  A
   configuration for this deployment scenario is referred to as a Split
   DNS configuration.

5.  PvD InternalDNSDomains Key

   As discussed in Section 4, the Enterprise internal resources tend to
   have internal-only DNS names and require the use of special internal-
   only DNS servers to get resolved.

   The PvD Key InternalDNSDomains adds support for private (internal-
   only) DNS domains.  These domains are intended to be resolved using
   non-public DNS servers that are only reachable to the devices
   attached to the Enterprise network.  DNS resolution for other domains
   remains unchanged.

   The InternalDnsDomains PvD Key is used to convey that the specified
   DNS domains must be resolved using an Enterprise DNS server.  Clients
   have to identify internal or managed domains.  The DNS root zone
   (".") MUST be ignored if it appears in InternalDNSDomains.  Other
   generic or public domains, such as Top-Level Domains (TLDs),
   similarly MUST be ignored if they appear in InternalDNSDomains.

   For each SplitDNSAllowed entry, the client MUST use the Enterprise
   provided DNS servers as the only resolvers for the listed domains and
   its subdomains and it MUST NOT attempt to resolve the provided DNS
   domains using external DNS servers.  Other domain names may be
   resolved using some other external DNS resolver(s) that are
   configured independently.

6.  PvD SplitDNSAllowed Key

   If an Enterprise network restricts all the DNS queries to be sent to
   the Internal DNS server, SplitDNSAllowed will be set to false.

Internet-Draft   Split DNS config in Enterprise Networks   February 2021


   Split DNS configurations may be preferable to sending all DNS queries
   to an Enterprise DNS server in some deployments.  This allows an
   endpoint to only send DNS queries for the enterprise to the internal
   DNS servers.  The Enterprise remains unaware of all non-enterprise
   (DNS) activity of the user.

   It also allows the Enterprise DNS servers to only be configured for
   the enterprise DNS domains, which removes the legal and technical
   responsibility of the enterprise to resolve every DNS domain
   potentially asked for by the endpoints.  For example, if the
   SplitDNSAllowed key specifies "example.test" and SplitDNSAllowed is
   set to true, then "example.test", "www.example.test", and
   "mail.eng.example.test" must be resolved using the internal DNS
   resolver(s), but "otherexample.test" and "ple.test" can be resolved
   using the system's external DNS resolver(s).

   If SplitDNSAllowed is set to false, the client should not trust the
   SplitDNSAllowed key in case of connecting to unknown or untrusted
   networks (e.g., coffee shops or hotel networks).  For example, if
   SplitDNSAllowed is set to false, client can choose to use a alternate
   network to resolve the external domain names.

7.  An Example

   The following example shows how the JSON keys defined in this
   document can be used:

      {
        "identifier": "cafe.example.com.",
        "expires": "2020-05-23T06:00:00Z",
        "prefixes": ["2001:db8:1::/48", "2001:db8:4::/48"],
        "SplitDNSAllowed": True,
        "InternalDNSDomains:": ["city.other.test", "example.com"]
      }

   The JSON keys "identifier", "expires", and "prefixes" are defined in
   [RFC8801].

8.  Roaming Enterprise Users

   In this Enterprise scenario (Section 1.1.3 of [RFC7296]), a roaming
   user connects to the Enterprise network through an VPN tunnel (e.g.,
   IPsec, SSL, Wireguard).  The split-tunnel Virtual Private Network
   (VPN) configuration allows the endpoint to access hosts that reside
   in the Enterprise network [RFC8598] using that tunnel; other traffic
   not destined to the Enterprise does not traverse the tunnel.  In
   contrast, a non-split- tunnel VPN configuration causes all traffic to
   traverse the tunnel into the Enterprise.

Internet-Draft   Split DNS config in Enterprise Networks   February 2021


   When the VPN tunnel is IPsec, the encrypted server hosted by the
   Enterprise network can be securely discovered by the endpoint using
   the ENCDNS_IP*_* IKEv2 Configuration Payload Attribute Types defined
   in [I-D.btw-add-ipsecme-ike].  For split-tunnel VPN configurations,
   the endpoint uses the Enterprise-provided encrypted DNS server to
   resolve internal-only domain names.  For non-split-tunnel VPN
   configurations, the endpoint uses the Enterprise-provided encrypted
   DNS server to resolve both internal and external domain names.

   Other VPN tunnel types have similar configuration capabilities, not
   detailed here.

9.  Upstream Encryption

   If an Enterprise network is using a local encrypted DNS server
   configured as a Forwarding DNS server [RFC8499] relying upon the
   upstream resolver (e.g., at an ISP) to perform recursive DNS lookups,
   DNS messages exchanged between the local encrypted DNS server and the
   recursive resolver MUST be encrypted.

   If the Enterprise network is using the local encrypted DNS server
   configured as a recursive DNS server, DNS messages exchanges between
   the recursive resolver and authoritative servers SHOULD be encrypted
   to conform to the requirements discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-dprive-phase2-requirements].

10.  Security Considerations

   Clients may want to preconfigure external domains for TLDs and
   Second-Level Domains (SLDs) to prevent malicious DNS redirections for
   well-known domains.  This prevents users from unknowingly giving DNS
   queries to third parties.  This is even more important if those well-
   known domains are not deploying DNSSEC, as the Enterprise network
   could then even modify the DNS answers without detection.

   The content of InternalDnsDomains and SplitDNSAllowed may be passed
   to another (DNS) program for processing.  As with any network input,
   the content SHOULD be considered untrusted and handled accordingly.
   The split DNS configuration assigned by an anonymous or unknown
   network (e.g., coffee shops) MUST be ignored by the client.

11.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add InternalDNSDomains and SplitDNSAllowed PvD
   Keys to the Additional Information PvD Keys registry
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/pvds/pvds.xhtml).
