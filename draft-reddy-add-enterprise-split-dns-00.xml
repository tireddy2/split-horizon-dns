    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC7626"></xref> discusses DNS privacy considerations
      in both "on the wire" (Section 2.4 of <xref target="RFC7626"></xref>)
      and "in the server" (Section 2.5 of <xref target="RFC7626"></xref>)
      contexts. In recent years there has also been an increase in the
      availability of "public resolvers" <xref target="RFC8499"></xref> which
      DNS clients may be pre-configured to use instead of the default network
      resolver for a variety of reasons (e.g., offer a good reachability,
      support an encrypted transport, provide a strong privacy policy, (lack
      of) filtering).</t>

      <t>If public (DoT) <xref target="RFC7858"></xref> or DNS-over-HTTPS
      (DoH) <xref target="RFC8484"></xref> servers are used instead of using
      local DNS servers, it can adversely impact Enterprise network-based
      security. Various network security services are provided by Enterprise
      networks to protect endpoints (e.g., laptops, printers, IoT devices),
      and to enforce enterprise policies. These policies may be necessary to
      protect employees, customers, or citizens. They are not the subject of
      this memo. Enterprise DNS servers in place for these purpose act on DNS
      requests originating from endpoints. However, if an endpoint uses public
      DoT or DoH servers, the desired enterprise protection and enforcement
      can be bypassed.</t>

      <t>In order to act on DNS requests from endpoints, network security
      services can block DoT traffic by dropping outgoing packets to
      destination port 853. Identifying DoH traffic is far more challenging
      than DoT traffic. Network security services may try to identify the
      well-known DoH resolvers by their domain name, and DNS-over-HTTPS
      traffic can be blocked by dropping outgoing packets to these domains.
      However, DoH traffic can not be fully identified without acting as a TLS
      proxy.</t>

      <t>If a network security service blocks access to the public DoH/DoT
      server, there are incompatibilities with the privacy profiles discussed
      in <xref target="RFC8310"></xref>: <list style="symbols">
          <t>If an endpoint has enabled strict privacy profile (Section 5 of
          <xref target="RFC8310"></xref>), the endpoint cannot resolve DNS
          names.</t>

          <t>If an endpoint has enabled opportunistic privacy profile (Section
          5 of <xref target="RFC8310"></xref>), the endpoint will either
          fallback to an encrypted connection without authenticating the DNS
          server provided by the local network or fallback to clear text DNS,
          and cannot exchange encrypted DNS messages. The fallback adversely
          impacts security and privacy as internal attacks are possible in
          Enterprise networks. For example, an internal attacker can modify
          the DNS responses to re-direct the client to malicious servers or
          pervasively monitor the DNS traffic. The reader may refer to Section
          3.2.1 of <xref target="I-D.arkko-farrell-arch-model-t"></xref> for a
          discussion on the need for more awareness about attacks from within
          closed domains.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>To overcome the above threats, this document specifies mechanism to
      convey internal-only DNS names to endpoints connected to an Enterprise
      network and to determine if the Enterprise networks allows split-horizon
      DNS. DNS clients can discover and authenticate encrypted DNS servers
      provided by the Enterprise network, for example using the techniques
      proposed in <xref target="I-D.btw-add-home"></xref> and <xref
      target="I-D.pauly-add-deer"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Provisioning Domains (PvDs) are defined in <xref
      target="RFC7556"></xref> as consistent sets of network configuration
      information. <xref target="RFC8801"></xref> defines a mechanism for
      discovering multiple Explicit PvDs on a single network and their
      Additional Information by means of an HTTP-over-TLS query using a URI
      derived from the PvD ID. This document defines two PvD Keys (1) The
      InternalDNSDomains PvD Key which is used to convey that the specified
      DNS domains must be resolved using the Enterprise DNS server (2) The
      SplitDNSAllowed PvD Key to determine if the Enterprise network allows
      split-horizon DNS.</t>

    <section anchor="notation" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
      <xref target="RFC2119"></xref><xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

      <t>This document makes use of the terms defined in <xref
      target="RFC8499"></xref> and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-ter"></xref>.</t>

      <t>'Encrypted DNS' refers to a DNS protocol that provides an encrypted
      channel between a DNS client and server (e.g., DoT, DoH, or DoQ).</t>

      <t>DNS resolution servers accessible only to devices attached to the
      Enterprise network will be referred to as "Internal DNS servers", and
      other DNS servers will be referred to as "external DNS servers".</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Scope" title="Scope of the Document">
      <t>If a device is managed by an enterprise's IT department, the device
      can be configured to use Enterprise-provided DoH/DoT servers. This
      configuration might be manual or rely upon whatever deployed device
      management tool in an Enterprise. For example, customizing Firefox using
      Group Policy to use the Enterprise DoH server is discussed in <xref
      target="Firefox-Policy"></xref> for Windows and MacOS, and setting
      Chrome policies is discussed in <xref target="Chrome-Policy"></xref> and
      <xref target="Chrome-DoH"></xref>.</t>

      <t>If mobile device management (MDM) (e.g., <xref
      target="MDM-Apple"></xref>) is used to secure BYOD, MDM can be used to
      configure OS/browser with the Enterprise provided DoH/DoT server. If an
      endpoint is on-boarded, for example, using Over-The-Air (OTA) enrollment
      <xref target="OTA"></xref> to provision the device with a certificate
      and configuration profile, the configuration profile can include the
      authentication domain name (ADN) of the DoH/DoT server. The OS/Browser
      can use the configuration profile to use the Enterprise provided DoH/DoT
      server. In this case, MDM is not installed on the device.</t>

      <t>Provisioning IT-managed devices, BYOD devices with MDM or
      configuration profile with the Split DNS configuration is out side the
      scope of this document.</t>

      <t>Typically, Enterprise networks do not assume that all devices in
      their network are managed by the IT team or Mobile Device Management
      (MDM), especially in the quite common BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)
      scenario. The endpoint can use the discovered Enterprise Encrypted DNS
      server to only access internal-only DNS names and use another public DNS
      server for public domains OR use the discovered Enterprise Encrypted DNS
      server to access both internal-only DNS names and public domains. The
      scope of this document is restricted to unmanaged BYOD devices without a
      configuration profile.</t>

      <t>Note: Many users have privacy and personal data sovereignty concerns
      with employers installing MDM on their personal devices; they are
      concerned that admin can glean personal information and could control
      how they use their devices. When users do not install MDM on their
      devices, IT admins do not get visibility into the security posture of
      those devices. To overcome this problem, a host agent can
      cryptographically attest the security status associated with device,
      such as minimum passcode length, biometric login enabled, OS version
      etc. This approach is fast gaining traction especially with the advent
      of closed OS like <xref target="win10s">Windows 10 in S mode</xref> or
      <xref target="Chromebook">Chromebook</xref>, where applications are
      sandboxed (e.g., ransomware attack is not possbile) and applications can
      only be installed via the OS store. Endpoints can use the credentials
      (username and password) provided by the IT admin to mutually
      authenticate to the Enterprise WiFi Access Point (e.g., PEAP-MSCHAPv2
      <xref target="PEAP"></xref>, EAP-pwd <xref target="RFC8146"></xref>,
      EAP-PSK <xref target="RFC4764"></xref>).</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="split-horizon" title="Split DNS ">
      <t><xref target="RFC2826"></xref> "does not preclude private networks
      from operating their own private name spaces" but notes that if private
      networks "wish to make use of names uniquely defined for the global
      Internet, they have to fetch that information from the global DNS naming
      hierarchy". There are various DNS deployments outside of the global
      public DNS, including "split horizon" deployments and DNS usages on
      private (or virtual private) networks. In a split horizon, an
      authoritative server gives different responses to queries from the
      public Internet than they do to internal DNS servers; while some
      deployments differentiate internal queries from public queries by the
      source IP address, the concerns in Section 3.1.1 of <xref
      target="RFC6950"></xref> relating to trusting source IP addresses apply
      to such deployments.</t>

      <t>When the internal address space range is private <xref
      target="RFC1918"></xref>, this makes it both easier for the server to
      discriminate public from private and harder for public entities to
      impersonate nodes in the private network. The use cases that motivate
      split-horizon DNS typically involve restricting access to some network
      services -- intranet resources such as internal web sites, development
      servers, or directories, for example -- while preserving the ease of use
      offered by domain names for internal users.</t>

      <t>An Enterprise can require one or more DNS domains to be resolved via
      internal DNS servers. This can be a special domain, such as
      "corp.example.com" for an enterprise that is publicly known to use
      "example.com". In this case, the endpoint needs to be informed what the
      internal-only domain names are and what the IP addresses of the internal
      DNS servers are. An enterprise can also run a different version of its
      public domain on its internal network. In that case, the client is
      instructed to send DNS queries for the enterprise public domain (e.g.,
      "example.com") to the internal DNS servers. A configuration for this
      deployment scenario is referred to as a Split DNS configuration.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="InternalDNSDomains" title="PvD InternalDNSDomains Key">
      <t>The Enterprise internal resources tend to have internal-only DNS
      names and require the use of special internal-only DNS servers to get
      resolved. The PvD Key InternalDNSDomains adds support for private
      (internal-only) DNS domains. These domains are intended to be resolved
      using non-public DNS servers that are only reachable to the devices
      attached to the Enterprise network. DNS resolution for other domains
      remains unchanged.</t>

      <t>The InternalDnsDomains PvD Key is used to convey that the specified
      DNS domains MUST be resolved using the Enterprise DNS server. Clients
      should take care to identify internal or managed domains. The DNS root
      zone (".") MUST be ignored if it appears in InternalDNSDomains. Other
      generic or public domains, such as Top-Level Domains (TLDs), similarly
      MUST be ignored if they appear in InternalDNSDomains unless the entity
      actually is the operator of the TLD.</t>

      <t>For each SplitDNSAllowed entry, the client MUST use the Enterprise
      provided DNS servers as the only resolvers for the listed domains and
      its subdomains, and it MUST NOT attempt to resolve the provided DNS
      domains using its external DNS servers. Other domain names can possibly
      be resolved using some other external DNS resolver(s) that are
      configured independently.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="SplitDNSAllowed" title="PvD SplitDNSAllowed Key">
      <t>If the Enterprise restricts all the DNS queries to be sent to the
      Internal DNS server, SplitDNSAllowed will be set to false. Split DNS
      configurations may be preferable to sending all DNS queries to the
      Enterprise DNS server in some deployments. This allows the endpoint to
      only send DNS queries for the enterprise to the internal DNS servers.
      The Enterprise remains unaware of all non-enterprise (DNS) activity of
      the user. It also allows the enterprise DNS servers to only be
      configured for the enterprise DNS domains, which removes the legal and
      technical responsibility of the enterprise to resolve every DNS domain
      potentially asked for by the endpoints. For example, if the
      SplitDNSAllowed key specifies "example.test" and SplitDNSAllowed is set
      to true, then "example.test", "www.example.test", and
      "mail.eng.example.test" MUST be resolved using the internal DNS
      resolver(s), but "otherexample.test" and "ple.test" can be resolved
      using the system's external DNS resolver(s).</t>

      <t>If SplitDNSAllowed is set to false, the client should not trust the
      SplitDNSAllowed key in case of connecting to unknown or untrusted
      networks (e.g., coffee shops or hotel networks). For example, If
      SplitDNSAllowed is set to false, client can choose to use a alternate
      network to resolve the external domain names.</t>

    <section anchor="VPN" title="Roaming Enterprise Users">
      <section title="VPN tunnel">
        <t>In this Enterprise scenario (Section 1.1.3 of <xref
        target="RFC7296"></xref>), a roaming user connects to the Enterprise
        network through an VPN tunnel (e.g., IPsec, SSL, Wireguard). The
        split-tunnel Virtual Private Network (VPN) configuration allows the
        endpoint to access hosts that reside in the Enterprise network <xref
        target="RFC8598"></xref> using that tunnel; other traffic not destined
        to the Enterprise does not traverse the tunnel. In contrast, a
        non-split- tunnel VPN configuration causes all traffic to traverse the
        tunnel into the enterprise.</t>

        <t>When the VPN tunnel is IPsec, The DoH/DoT server hosted by the
        Enterprise network can be securely discovered by the endpoint using
        the INTERNAL_ENC_DNS IKEv2 Configuration Payload Attribute Type
        defined in <xref target="I-D.btw-add-ipsecme-ike"></xref>. For
        split-tunnel VPN configurations, the endpoint uses the
        Enterprise-provided DoT/DoH server to resolve internal-only domain
        names. For non-split-tunnel VPN configurations, the endpoint uses the
        Enterprise-provided DoT/DoH server to resolve both internal and
        external domain names.</t>

        <t>Other VPN tunnel types have similar configuration capabilities, not
        detailed here.</t>

    <section title="Upstream Encryption">
      <t>If the Enterprise network is using the local DoH/DoT server
      configured as a Forwarding DNS server <xref target="RFC8499"></xref>
      relying on the upstream resolver (e.g., at an ISP) to perform recursive
      DNS lookups, DNS messages exchanged between the local DoH/DoT server and
      recursive resolver MUST be encrypted. If the Enterprise network is using
      the local DoH/DoT server configured as a recursive DNS server, DNS
      messages exchanges between the recursive resolver and authoritative
      servers SHOULD be encrypted to conform to the requirements discussed in
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-dprive-phase2-requirements"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Clients MAY want to pre-configure external domains for Top-Level
      Domains (TLDs) and Second-Level Domains (SLDs) to prevent malicious DNS
      redirections for well-known domains. This prevents users from
      unknowingly giving DNS queries to third parties. This is even more
      important if those well-known domains are not deploying DNSSEC, as the
      Enterprise network could then even modify the DNS answers without
      detection.</t>

      <t>The content of InternalDnsDomains and SplitDNSAllowed may be passed
      to another (DNS) program for processing. As with any network input, the
      content SHOULD be considered untrusted and handled accordingly. The
      split DNS configuration assigned by an anonymous or unknown network
      (e.g., coffee shops) MUST be ignored by the client.</t>
