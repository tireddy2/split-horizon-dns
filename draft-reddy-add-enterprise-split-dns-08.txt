                    Split-Horizon DNS Configuration
                draft-reddy-add-enterprise-split-dns-08

Abstract

   When split-horizon DNS is deployed by a network, certain domains can
   be resolved authoritatively by the network-provided DNS resolver.
   DNS clients that don't always use this resolver might wish to do so
   for these domains.  This specification enables networks to inform DNS
   clients about domains that are inside the split horizon DNS, and
   describes how clients can confirm the local resolver's authority over
   these domains.

1.  Introduction

   To resolve a DNS query, there are three essential behaviors that an
   implementation can apply: (1) answer from a local database, (2) query
   the relevant authorities and their parents, or (3) ask a server to
   query those authorities and return the final answer.  Implementations
   that use these behaviors are called "authoritative nameservers",
   "full resolvers", and "forwarders" (or "stub resolvers").  However,
   an implementation can also implement a mixture of these behaviors,
   depending on a local policy, for each query.  We term such an
   implementation a "hybrid resolver".

   Most DNS resolvers are hybrids of some kind.  For example, stub
   resolvers frequently support a local "hosts file" that preempts query
   forwarding, and most DNS forwarders and full resolvers can also serve
   responses from a local zone file.  Other standardized hybrid
   resolution behaviors include Local Root [RFC8806], mDNS [RFC6762],
   and NXDOMAIN synthesis for .onion [RFC7686].

   In many network environments, the network offers clients a DNS server
   (e.g. in DHCP OFFER, IPv6 Router Advertisement).  Although this
   server is formally specified as a recursive resolver (e.g.

Internet-Draft       Split-Horizon DNS Configuration        January 2022


   Section 5.1 of [RFC6106]), some networks provide a hybrid resolver
   instead.  If this resolver acts as an authoritative server for some
   names, we say that the network has "split horizon DNS", because those
   names resolve in this way only from inside the network.

   Network clients that use pure stub resolution, sending all queries to
   the network-provided resolver, will always receive the split-horizon
   results.  Conversely, clients that send all queries to a different
   resolver or implement pure full resolution locally will never receive
   them.  Clients with either pure resolution behavior are out of scope
   for this specification.  Instead, this specification enables hybrid
   clients to access split-horizon results from a network-provided
   hybrid resolver, while using a different resolution method for some
   or all other names.

   To achieve the required security properties, clients must be able to
   authenticate the DNS servers provided by the network, for example
   using the techniques proposed in [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] and
   [I-D.ietf-add-ddr], and prove that they are authorized to serve the
   offered split-horizon names.  As a result, use of this specification
   is limited to servers that support authenticated encryption and
   split-horizon names that are properly rooted in the global DNS.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8499].  The terms
   "Private DNS", "Global DNS" and "Split DNS" are defined in [RFC8499].

   'Encrypted DNS' refers to a DNS protocol that provides an encrypted
   channel between a DNS client and server (e.g., DoT, DoH, or DoQ).

   The terms 'Authorized Split Horizon' and 'Domain Camping' are also
   defined.

2.1.  Authorized Split Horizon

   A split horizon configuration for some name is considered
   "authorized" if any parent of that name has given the local network
   permission to serve its own responses for that name.  Such
   authorizations generally extend to the entire subtree of names below
   the authorization point.

2.2.  Domain Camping

   Domain Camping refers to operating a nameserver which claims to be
   authoritative for a zone, but actually isn't.  For example, a domain
   called example.com on the Internet and an internal DNS server also
   claims to be authoritative for example.com, but has no delegation
   from example.com on the Internet.  Someone might domain camp on a
   popular domain name providing the ability to monitor queries and
   modify answers for that domain.

   A common variation on domain camping is "NXDOMAIN camping", in which
   a nameserver claims a zone that does not exist in the global DNS.
   This is a form of domain camping because it seizes a portion of the
   parent zone without permission.  The use of nonexistent TLDs for
   local services is a form of NXDOMAIN camping on the root zone.

   Domain camping can be used as an attack vector to impersonate a
   targeted domain.  Any form of domain camping likely violates the
   IAB's guidance regarding "the Unique DNS Root" [RFC2826].

3.  Provisioning Domains dnsZones

   Provisioning Domains (PvDs) are defined in [RFC7556] as sets of
   network configuration information that clients can use to access
   networks, including rules for DNS resolution and proxy configuration.
   The PvD Key dnsZones is defined in [RFC8801].  The PvD Key dnsZones
   notifies clients of names for which one of the network-provided
   resolvers is authoritative.  Attempting to resolve these names via
   another resolver might fail or return results that are not correct
   for this network.

   Each dnsZones entry indicates a claim of authority over a domain and
   its subdomains.  For example, if the dnsZones entry is
   "example.test", this covers "example.test", "www.example.test", and
   "mail.eng.example.test", but not "otherexample.test" or
   "example.test.net".

   [RFC8801] defines a mechanism for discovering multiple Explicit PvDs
   on a single network and their Additional Information by means of an
   HTTP-over-TLS query using a URI derived from the PvD ID.  This set of
   additional configuration information is referred to as a Web
   Provisioning Domain (Web PvD).  The PvD RA option defined in
   [RFC8801] SHOULD set the H-flag to indicate that Additional
   Information is available.  This Additional Information JSON object
   SHOULD include the "dnsZones" key to define the DNS domains for which
   the network claims authority.

3.1.  Confirming Authority over the Domains

   To comply with [RFC2826], each dnsZones entry must be authorized in
   the global DNS hierarchy.  To prevent domain camping, clients SHOULD
   confirm this authorization before making use of the entry.

   To enable confirmation, the client MUST discover and validate the
   Authentication Domain Names (ADNs) of the network-designated
   resolvers using a method such as DNR [I-D.ietf-add-dnr].  The client
   MUST also perform an NS query for each dnsZones entry and confirm
   that at least one of the ADNs appears in each NS RRSet.  This NS
   query SHOULD be conducted in a manner that is not vulnerable to
   tampering by the local network.  Suitable tamperproof resolution
   strategies are described in Section 3.1.1 and Section 3.1.2.

   Note that this confirmation of authority applies only to the specific
   resolvers whose ADNs appear in each RRSet.  If a network offers
   multiple encrypted resolvers via DNR, each dnsZone entry may be
   authorized for a distinct subset of the resolvers.  If TLS
   certificate validation fails for the ADN, that resolver MUST NOT be
   considered authorized.

3.1.1.  Confirmation using a pre-configured public resolver

   The client sends an NS query for the domain in dnsZones to a pre-
   configured resolver that is external to the network, over a secure
   transport.  Clients SHOULD apply whatever acceptance rules they would
   otherwise apply when using this resolver (e.g. checking the AD bit,
   revalidating DNSSEC).

3.1.2.  Confirmation using DNSSEC

   The client resolves the NS record using any resolution method of its
   choice (e.g. querying one of the network-provided resolvers,
   performing iterative resolution locally), and performs full DNSSEC
   validation locally [RFC6698].  If the result is "Insecure" (Section 5
   of [RFC4034]), clients SHOULD retry using the method in
   Section 3.1.1.

4.  An example of Split-Horizon DNS Configuration

   Consider an organization that operates "example.com", and runs a
   different version of its global domain on its internal network.
   Today, on the Internet it publishes two NS records, "ns1.example.com"
   and "ns2.example.com".

   To add support for the mechanism described in this document, the
   network and endpoints first need to support [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] and



Reddy, et al.             Expires July 17, 2022                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       Split-Horizon DNS Configuration        January 2022


   [RFC8801].  Then, for each site, the administrator would add DNS
   servers named "ns1.example.com" or "ns2.example.com" (the names
   published on the Internet).  Those names would be advertised to the
   endpoints as described in [I-D.ietf-add-dnr].

   The endpoints compliant with this specification can then determine
   the network's internal nameservers are owned and managed by the same
   entity that has published the NS records on the Internet as shown in
   Figure 1:

   Steps 1-2:  The client joins the network, obtains an IP address, and
      discovers the resolvers "ns1.example.com" and "ns2.example.com"
      and their IP addresses using DNR [I-D.ietf-add-dnr].  Using
      [RFC8801], the client also discovers the PvD FQDN is
      "pvd.example.com".

   Steps 3-7:  The client establishes an encrypted DNS connection with
      "ns1.example.com", validates its TLS certificate, and queries it
      for "pvd.example.com" to retrieve the PvD JSON object.  Note that
      [RFC8801] in Section 4.1 mandates the PvD FQDN MUST be resolved
      using the DNS servers indicated by the associated PvD.  The PvD
      contains:

    {
       "identifier": "pvd.example.com",
       "expires": "2020-05-23T06:00:00Z",
       "prefixes": ["2001:db8:1::/48", "2001:db8:4::/48"],
       "dnsZones:": ["example.com"]
     }

      The JSON keys "identifier", "expires", and "prefixes" are defined
      in [RFC8801].

   Steps 8-9:  The client then uses an encrypted DNS connection to a
      public resolver (e.g., 1.1.1.1) to issue NS queries for the
      domains in dnsZones.  The NS lookup for "example.com" will return
      "ns1.example.com" and "ns2.example.com".

   Step 10:  As the network-provided nameservers are the same as the
      names retrieved from the public resolver and the network-
      designated resolver's certificate includes at least one of the
      names retrieved from the public resolver, the client has finished
      validation that the nameservers signaled in [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] and
      [RFC8801] are owned and managed by the same entity that published
      the NS records on the Internet.  The endpoint will then use that
      information from [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] and [RFC8801] to resolve names
      within dnsZones.

          Figure 1: An Example of Split-Horizon DNS Configuration

5.  Split DNS Configuration for IKEv2

   The split-tunnel Virtual Private Network (VPN) configuration allows
   the endpoint to access resources that reside in the VPN [RFC8598] via
   the tunnel; other traffic not destined to the VPN does not traverse
   the tunnel.  In contrast, a non-split-tunnel VPN configuration causes
   all traffic to traverse the tunnel into the VPN.

   When the VPN tunnel is IPsec, the encrypted DNS resolver hosted by
   the VPN service provider can be securely discovered by the endpoint
   using the ENCDNS_IP*_* IKEv2 Configuration Payload Attribute Types
   defined in [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-add-ike].  For split-tunnel VPN
   configurations, the endpoint uses the discovered encrypted DNS server
   to resolve domain names for which the VPN provider claims authority.
   For non-split-tunnel VPN configurations, the endpoint uses the
   discovered encrypted DNS server to resolve both global and private
   domain names.  For split-tunnel VPN configurations, the IKE client
   can use any one of the mechanisms discussed in Section 3.1 to
   determine if the VPN service provider is authoritative over the Split
   Horizon DNS domains.

   Other VPN tunnel types have similar configuration capabilities, not
   detailed here.

6.  Security Considerations

   The content of dnsZones may be passed to another (DNS) program for
   processing.  As with any network input, the content SHOULD be
   considered untrusted and handled accordingly.  The client must
   perform the mechanisms discussed in Section 3.1 to determine if the
   network-designated encrypted resolvers are authoritative over the
   domains in dnsZones.  If they are not, the client SHOULD ignore those
   dnsZones.

   This specification does not alter DNSSEC validation behavior.  To
   ensure compatibility with validating clients, network operators MUST

   ensure that names under the split horizon are correctly signed or
   place them in an unsigned zone.
