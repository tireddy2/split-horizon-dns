                   Validating Claims of DNS Authority
                draft-reddy-add-enterprise-split-dns-10

Abstract

   When split-horizon DNS is deployed by a network, certain domains can
   be resolved authoritatively by the network-provided DNS resolver.
   DNS clients that don't always use this resolver might wish to do so
   for these domains.  This specification describes how clients can
   confirm the local resolver's authority over these domains.

1.  Introduction

   To resolve a DNS query, there are three essential behaviors that an
   implementation can apply: (1) answer from a local database, (2) query
   the relevant authorities and their parents, or (3) ask a server to
   query those authorities and return the final answer.  Implementations
   that use these behaviors are called "authoritative nameservers",
   "full resolvers", and "forwarders" (or "stub resolvers").  However,
   an implementation can also implement a mixture of these behaviors,
   depending on a local policy, for each query.  We term such an
   implementation a "hybrid resolver".

   Most DNS resolvers are hybrids of some kind.  For example, stub
   resolvers frequently support a local "hosts file" that preempts query
   forwarding, and most DNS forwarders and full resolvers can also serve



Reddy, et al.          Expires September 29, 2022               [Page 2]

Internet-Draft     Validating Claims of DNS Authority         March 2022


   responses from a local zone file.  Other standardized hybrid
   resolution behaviors include Local Root [RFC8806], mDNS [RFC6762],
   and NXDOMAIN synthesis for .onion [RFC7686].

   In many network environments, the network offers clients a DNS server
   (e.g.  DHCP OFFER, IPv6 Router Advertisement).  Although this server
   is formally specified as a recursive resolver (e.g.  Section 5.1 of
   [RFC6106]), some networks provide a hybrid resolver instead.  If this
   resolver acts as an authoritative server for some names, we say that
   the network has "split-horizon DNS", because those names resolve in
   this way only from inside the network.

   Network clients that use pure stub resolution, sending all queries to
   the network-provided resolver, will always receive the split-horizon
   results.  Conversely, clients that send all queries to a different
   resolver or implement pure full resolution locally will never receive
   them.  Clients with either pure resolution behavior are out of scope
   for this specification.  Instead, this specification enables hybrid
   clients to access split-horizon results from a network-provided
   hybrid resolver, while using a different resolution method for some
   or all other names.

   To achieve the required security properties, clients must be able to
   authenticate the DNS servers provided by the network, for example
   using the techniques proposed in [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] and
   [I-D.ietf-add-ddr], and prove that they are authorized to serve the
   offered split-horizon DNS names.  As a result, use of this
   specification is limited to servers that support authenticated
   encryption and split-horizon DNS names that are properly rooted in
   the global DNS.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8499].  The term
   "Global DNS" is defined in [RFC8499].

   'Encrypted DNS' refers to a DNS protocol that provides an encrypted
   channel between a DNS client and server (e.g., DoT, DoH, or DoQ).

   The terms 'Validated Split-Horizon' and 'Domain Camping' are also
   defined.

Internet-Draft     Validating Claims of DNS Authority         March 2022


2.1.  Validated Split-Horizon

   A split horizon configuration for some name is considered "validated"
   if any parent of that name has given the local network permission to
   serve its own responses for that name.  Such validation generally
   extend to the entire subtree of names below the authorization point.

2.2.  Domain Camping

   Domain Camping refers to operating a nameserver which claims to be
   authoritative for a zone, but actually isn't.  For example, a domain
   called example.com on the Internet and an internal DNS server also
   claims to be authoritative for example.com, but has no delegation
   from example.com on the Internet.  Someone might domain camp on a
   popular domain name providing the ability to monitor queries and
   modify answers for that domain.

   A common variation on domain camping is "NXDOMAIN camping", in which
   a nameserver claims a zone that does not exist in the global DNS.
   This is a form of domain camping because it seizes a portion of the
   parent zone without permission.  The use of nonexistent TLDs for
   local services is a form of NXDOMAIN camping on the root zone.

   Any form of domain camping likely violates the IAB's guidance
   regarding "the Unique DNS Root" [RFC2826].

3.  Scope

   The protocol in this document allows the domain owner to create a
   split-horizon DNS.  Other entities which do not own the domain are
   detected by the client.  Thus, DNS filtering is not enabled by this
   protocol.

4.  Learning Local Claims of DNS Authority

   As a first step, the host joins a network and determines if that
   network contains a local DNS server which claims authority over a
   zone.  Two methods of performing that function are described below,
   host configuration and provisioning domains.

4.1.  Host Configuration

   A host can be configured with DNS information when it joins a
   network, including when it brings up VPN (which is also considered
   joining a(n additional) network, detailed in Section 7).  Existing
   implementations determine the host has joined a certain network via
   SSID, IP subnet assigned, DNS server IP address or name, and other
   similar mechanisms.  For example, one existing implementation



Reddy, et al.          Expires September 29, 2022               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     Validating Claims of DNS Authority         March 2022


   determines the host has joined an internal network because the DHCP-
   assigned IP address belongs to the company's IP address (as assigned
   by the regional IP addressing authority) and the DHCP-advertised DNS
   IP address is one used by IT at that network.  Other mechanisms exist
   in other products but are not interesting to this specification;
   rather what is interesting is this step to determine "we have joined
   the internal corporate network" occurred and the DNS server is
   configured as authoritative for certain DNS zones (e.g.,
   *.example.com).

   Because a rogue network can simulate all or most of the above
   characteristics this specification details how to validate these
   claims in Section 5.

4.2.  Provisioning Domains dnsZones

   Provisioning Domains (PvDs) are defined in [RFC7556] as sets of
   network configuration information that clients can use to access
   networks, including rules for DNS resolution and proxy configuration.
   The PvD Key dnsZones is defined in [RFC8801].  The PvD Key dnsZones
   notifies clients of names for which one of the network-provided
   resolvers is authoritative.  Attempting to resolve these names via
   another resolver might fail or return results that are not correct
   for this network.

   Each dnsZones entry indicates a claim of authority over a domain and
   its subdomains.  For example, if the dnsZones entry is
   "example.test", this covers "example.test", "www.example.test", and
   "mail.eng.example.test", but not "otherexample.test" or
   "example.test.net".

   [RFC8801] defines a mechanism for discovering multiple Explicit PvDs
   on a single network and their Additional Information by means of an
   HTTP-over-TLS query using a URI derived from the PvD ID.  This set of
   additional configuration information is referred to as a Web
   Provisioning Domain (Web PvD).  The PvD RA option defined in
   [RFC8801] SHOULD set the H-flag to indicate that Additional
   Information is available.  This Additional Information JSON object
   SHOULD include the "dnsZones" key to define the DNS domains for which
   the network claims authority.

5.  Validating Claims of DNS Authority

   The client validates each of the learned DNS claims learned above
   using a public resolver or DNSSEC.

   Each learned DNS claim is authorized only for the specific resolvers
   whose names appear in its NS RRSet.  If a network offers multiple



Reddy, et al.          Expires September 29, 2022               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     Validating Claims of DNS Authority         March 2022


   encrypted resolvers (for example via DNR or via host configuration),
   each DNS zone entry may be authorized for distinct subset(s) of the
   network-provided resolvers.

   A zone is termed a "Validated Split-Horizon zone" after successful
   validation by a public resolver or by DNSSEC.

5.1.  Using Pre-configured Public Resolver

   The client sends an NS query for the domain in dnsZones to a pre-
   configured resolver that is external to the network, over a secure
   transport.  Clients SHOULD apply whatever acceptance rules they would
   otherwise apply when using this resolver (e.g. checking the AD bit,
   validating RRSIGs).

5.2.  Using DNSSEC

   The client resolves the NS record using any resolution method of its
   choice (e.g. querying one of the network-provided resolvers,
   performing iterative resolution locally), and performs full DNSSEC
   validation locally [RFC6698].  The result is processed based on its
   DNSSEC validation state (Section 4.3 of [RFC4035]):

   Secure:  the NS record is used for validation.

   Bogus or Indeterminate:  the record is rejected and validation is
      considered to have failed.

   Insecure:  the client SHOULD retry the validation process using a
      different method, such as the one in Section 5.1, to ensure
      compatibility with unsigned names.

6.  Examples of Split-Horizon DNS Configuration

   Two examples are shown below.  The first example showing an company
   with an internal-only DNS server resolving the entire zone for that
   company (e.g., *.example.com) the second example resolving only a
   subdomain of the company's zone (e.g., *.internal.example.com).

6.1.  Split-Horizon Entire Zone

   Consider an organization that operates "example.com", and runs a
   different version of its global domain on its internal network.
   Today, on the Internet it publishes two NS records, "ns1.example.com"
   and "ns2.example.com".

   The host and network first need mutual support one of the mechanisms
   described in learning (Section 4).  Shown in Figure 1 is learning
   using DNR and PvD.

   Validation is then perfomed using either Public DNS (Figure 2) or
   DNSSEC (Figure 3).

   Note steps 1-7 determine the local network claims which could also be
   determined with a priori host configuration and probing the local
   network (Section 4).

   steps 1-7:  The client determines the network's DNS claims using
      other standards.  Step 1 the host discovers the network resolvers
      "ns1.example.com" and "ns2.example.com" and their IP addresses
      using DNR [I-D.ietf-add-dnr].  In step 2 using [RFC8801] the
      client also discovers the PvD FQDN is "pvd.example.com".  In step
      3 The client establishes an encrypted DNS connection with
      "ns1.example.com", validates its TLS certificate, and queries it
      for "pvd.example.com" to retrieve the PvD JSON object.  Note that
      [RFC8801] in Section 4.1 mandates the PvD FQDN MUST be resolved
      using the DNS servers indicated by the associated PvD.  The PvD
      contains:

    {
       "identifier": "pvd.example.com",
       "expires": "2020-05-23T06:00:00Z",
       "prefixes": ["2001:db8:1::/48", "2001:db8:4::/48"],
       "dnsZones:": ["example.com"]
     }

      The JSON keys "identifier", "expires", and "prefixes" are defined
      in [RFC8801].

6.1.1.  Verification using Public Resolver

   The figure below shows the steps performed to verify the local claims
   of DNS authority using a public resolver.

   Steps 8-9:  The client uses an encrypted DNS connection to a public
      resolver (e.g., 1.1.1.1) to issue NS queries for the domains in

      dnsZones.  The NS lookup for "example.com" will return
      "ns1.example.com" and "ns2.example.com".

   Step 10:  As the network-provided nameservers are the same as the
      names retrieved from the public resolver and the network-
      designated resolver's certificate includes at least one of the
      names retrieved from the public resolver, the client has finished
      validation that the nameservers signaled in [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] and
      [RFC8801] are owned and managed by the same entity that published
      the NS records on the Internet.  The endpoint will then use that
      information from [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] and [RFC8801] to resolve names
      within dnsZones.

   Steps 8-9:  The client queries the network encrypted resolver
      connection to a public resolver (e.g., 1.1.1.1) to issue NS
      queries for the domains in dnsZones.  The NS lookup for
      "example.com" will return "ns1.example.com" and "ns2.example.com".

   Step 10:  As the network-provided nameservers are the same as the
      names retrieved from the public resolver and the network-
      designated resolver's certificate includes at least one of the
      names retrieved from the public resolver, the client has finished
      validation that the nameservers signaled in [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] and
      [RFC8801] are owned and managed by the same entity that published
      the NS records on the Internet.  The endpoint will then use that
      information from [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] and [RFC8801] to resolve names
      within dnsZones.

6.2.  Split-Horizon Only Subdomain of Zone

   A subdomain can also be used for all internal DNS names (e.g., the
   zone internal.example.com exists only on the internal DNS server).
   For successful validation described in this document the the internal
   DNS server will need a certificate signed by a CA trusted by the
   client.  If a publicly-signed certificate is used, this means the
   internal zone name will exist in Certificate Transparancy [RFC9162]
   logs.  However, individual host names (e.g.,
   www.internal.example.com) will not be listed in Certificate
   Transparancy logs for the validation described in this document.

   For such a name internal.example.com the message flows work
   identically as with Section 6.1, the only difference that queries for
   example.com (e.g., www.example.com) which are not within
   internal.example.com are sent to the normal resolver rather than to
   the internal resolver.

7.  Split-Horizon DNS Configuration for IKEv2

   The split-tunnel Virtual Private Network (VPN) configuration allows
   the endpoint to access resources that reside in the VPN [RFC8598] via
   the tunnel; other traffic not destined to the VPN does not traverse
   the tunnel.  In contrast, a non-split-tunnel VPN configuration causes
   all traffic to traverse the tunnel into the VPN.

   When the VPN tunnel is IPsec, the encrypted DNS resolver hosted by
   the VPN service provider can be securely discovered by the endpoint
   using the ENCDNS_IP*_* IKEv2 Configuration Payload Attribute Types
   defined in [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-add-ike].  For split-tunnel VPN
   configurations, the endpoint uses the discovered encrypted DNS server
   to resolve domain names for which the VPN provider claims authority.
   For non-split-tunnel VPN configurations, the endpoint uses the
   discovered encrypted DNS server to resolve both global and private
   domain names.  For split-tunnel VPN configurations, the IKE client
   can use any one of the mechanisms discussed in Section 5 to determine
   if the VPN service provider is authoritative over the Split-Horizon
   DNS domains.

   Other VPN tunnel types have similar configuration capabilities, not
   detailed here.

8.  Security Considerations

   When using dnsZones (Section 4.2) the content of dnsZones may be
   passed to another (DNS) program for processing.  As with any network
   input, the content SHOULD be considered untrusted and handled
   accordingly.  The client must perform the mechanisms discussed in

   Section 5 to determine if the network-designated encrypted resolvers
   are authoritative over the domains in dnsZones.  If they are not, the
   client must ignore those dnsZones.

   This specification does not alter DNSSEC validation behaviour.  To
   ensure compatibility with validating clients, network operators MUST
   ensure that names under the split-horizon are correctly signed or
   place them in an unsigned zone.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
