     Establishing Local DNS Authority in Split-Horizon Environments
                draft-reddy-add-enterprise-split-dns-10

Abstract

   When split-horizon DNS is deployed by a network, certain domains can
   be resolved authoritatively by the network-provided DNS resolver.
   DNS clients that don't always use this resolver might wish to do so
   for these domains.  This specification describes how clients can
   confirm the local resolver's authority over these domains.

1.  Introduction

   To resolve a DNS query, there are three essential behaviors that an
   implementation can apply: (1) answer from a local database, (2) query
   the relevant authorities and their parents, or (3) ask a server to
   query those authorities and return the final answer.  Implementations
   that use these behaviors are called "authoritative nameservers",
   "full resolvers", and "forwarders" (or "stub resolvers").  However,
   an implementation can also implement a mixture of these behaviors,
   depending on a local policy, for each query.  We term such an
   implementation a "hybrid resolver".

   Most DNS resolvers are hybrids of some kind.  For example, stub
   resolvers frequently support a local "hosts file" that preempts query
   forwarding, and most DNS forwarders and full resolvers can also serve
   responses from a local zone file.  Other standardized hybrid
   resolution behaviors include Local Root [RFC8806], mDNS [RFC6762],
   and NXDOMAIN synthesis for .onion [RFC7686].

   In many network environments, the network offers clients a DNS server
   (e.g.  DHCP OFFER, IPv6 Router Advertisement).  Although this server
   is formally specified as a recursive resolver (e.g.  Section 5.1 of
   [RFC6106]), some networks provide a hybrid resolver instead.  If this
   resolver acts as an authoritative server for some names, we say that
   the network has "split-horizon DNS", because those names resolve in
   this way only from inside the network.

   Network clients that use pure stub resolution, sending all queries to
   the network-provided resolver, will always receive the split-horizon
   results.  Conversely, clients that send all queries to a different
   resolver or implement pure full resolution locally will never receive
   them.  Clients with either pure resolution behavior are out of scope
   for this specification.  Instead, this specification enables hybrid
   clients to access split-horizon results from a network-provided
   hybrid resolver, while using a different resolution method for some
   or all other names.

   There are several existing mechanisms for a network to provide
   clients with "local domain hints", listing domain names that have
   special treatment in this network (Section 4).  However, none of the
   local domain hint mechanisms enable clients to determine whether this
   special treatment is authorized by the domain owner.  Instead, these
   specifications require clients to make their own determinations about
   whether to trust and rely on these hints.

   This specification describes a protocol between domains, networks,
   and clients that allows the network to establish its authority over a
   domain to a client (Section 5).  Clients can use this protocol to
   confirm that a local domain hint was authorized by the domain
   (Section 6), which might influence its processing of that hint.

   This specification relies on securely identified local DNS servers
   and globally valid NS records.  Use of this specification is
   therefore limited to servers that support authenticated encryption
   and split-horizon DNS names that are properly rooted in the global
   DNS.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8499].  The term
   "Global DNS" is defined in [RFC8499].

   'Encrypted DNS' refers to a DNS protocol that provides an encrypted
   channel between a DNS client and server (e.g., DoT, DoH, or DoQ).

   The term 'Validated Split-Horizon' is also defined.

2.1.  Validated Split-Horizon

   A split horizon configuration for some name is considered "validated"
   if the network client has confirmed that a parent of that name has
   authorized the local network to serve its own responses for that
   name.  Such authorization generally extends to the entire subtree of
   names below the authorization point.

3.  Scope

   The protocol in this document allows the domain owner to create a
   split-horizon DNS.  Other entities which do not own the domain are
   detected by the client.  Thus, DNS filtering is not enabled by this
   protocol.

4.  Local Domain Hint Mechanisms

   There are various mechanisms by which a network client might learn
   "local domain hints", which indicate a special treatment for
   particular domain names upon joining a network.  This section
   provides a review of some common and standardized mechanisms for
   receiving domain hints.

4.1.  DHCP Options

   There are several DHCP options that convey local domain hints of
   different kinds.  The most directly relevant is "RDNSS Selection"
   [RFC6731], which provides "a list of domains ... about which the
   RDNSS has special knowledge", along with a "High", "Medium", or "Low"
   preference for each name.  The specification notes the difficulty of
   relying on these hints without validation:




Reddy, et al.           Expires October 14, 2022                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      Establishing Local DNS Authority          April 2022


      Trustworthiness of an interface and configuration information
      received over the interface is implementation and/or node
      deployment dependent, and the details of determining that trust
      are beyond the scope of this specification.

   Other local domain hints in DHCP include the "Domain Name" [RFC2132],
   "Access Network Domain Name" [RFC5986], "Client FQDN"
   [RFC4702][RFC4704], and "Name Service Search" [RFC2937] options.
   This specification may help clients to interpret these hints.  For
   example, a rogue DHCP server could use the "Client FQDN" option to
   assign a client the name "www.example.com" in order to prevent the
   client from reaching the true "www.example.com".  A client could use
   this specification to check the network's authority over this name,
   and adjust its behavior to avoid this attack if authority is not
   established.

   The Domain Search option [RFC3397] [RFC3646], which offers clients a
   way to expand short names into Fully Qualified Domain Names, is not a
   "local domain hint" by this definition, because it does not modify
   the processing of any specific domain.  (The specification notes that
   this option can be a "fruitful avenue of attack for a rogue DHCP
   server", and provides a number of cautions against accepting it
   unconditionally.)

4.2.  Host Configuration

   A host can be configured with DNS information when it joins a
   network, including when it brings up VPN (which is also considered
   joining a(n additional) network, detailed in Section 8).  Existing
   implementations determine the host has joined a certain network via
   SSID, IP subnet assigned, DNS server IP address or name, and other
   similar mechanisms.  For example, one existing implementation
   determines the host has joined an internal network because the DHCP-
   assigned IP address belongs to the company's IP address (as assigned
   by the regional IP addressing authority) and the DHCP-advertised DNS
   IP address is one used by IT at that network.  Other mechanisms exist
   in other products but are not interesting to this specification;
   rather what is interesting is this step to determine "we have joined
   the internal corporate network" occurred and the DNS server is
   configured as authoritative for certain DNS zones (e.g.,
   *.example.com).

   Because a rogue network can simulate all or most of the above
   characteristics this specification details how to validate these
   claims in Section 6.

4.3.  Provisioning Domains dnsZones

   Provisioning Domains (PvDs) are defined in [RFC7556] as sets of
   network configuration information that clients can use to access
   networks, including rules for DNS resolution and proxy configuration.
   The PvD Key "dnsZones" is defined in [RFC8801] as a list of "DNS
   zones searchable and accessible" in this provisioning domain.
   Attempting to resolve these names via another resolver might fail or
   return results that are not correct for this network.

4.4.  Split DNS Configuration for IKEv2

   In IKEv2 VPNs, the INTERNAL_DNS_DOMAIN configuration attribute can be
   used to indicate that a domain is "internal" to the VPN [RFC8598].
   To prevent abuse, the specification notes various possible
   restrictions on the use of this attribute:

      "If a client is configured by local policy to only accept a
      limited set of INTERNAL_DNS_DOMAIN values, the client MUST ignore
      any other INTERNAL_DNS_DOMAIN values."

      "IKE clients MAY want to require whitelisted domains for Top-Level
      Domains (TLDs) and Second-Level Domains (SLDs) to further prevent
      malicious DNS redirections for well-known domains."

   Within these guidelines, a client could adopt a local policy of
   accepting INTERNAL_DNS_DOMAIN values only when it can validate the
   local DNS server's authority over those names as described in this
   specification.

5.  Establishing Local DNS Authority

   To establish its authority over some DNS zone, a participating
   network MUST offer one or more encrypted resolvers via DNR
   [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] or an equivalent mechanism (see Section 8).  At
   least one of these resolvers' Authentication Domain Names (ADNs) MUST
   appear in an NS record for that zone.  This arrangement establishes
   this resolver's authority over the zone.

6.  Validating Authority over Local Domain Hints

   To validate the network's authority over a domain name, participating
   clients MUST resolve the NS record for that name.  If the resolution
   result is NODATA, the client MUST remove the last label and repeat
   the query until a response other than NODATA is received.

   Once the NS record has been resolved, the client MUST check if each
   local encrypted resolver's Authentication Domain Name appears in the

Internet-Draft      Establishing Local DNS Authority          April 2022


   NS record.  The client SHALL regard each such resolver as
   authoritative for the zone of this NS record.

   Each validation of authority applies only to the specific resolvers
   whose names appear in the NS RRSet.  If a network offers multiple
   encrypted resolvers, each DNS entry may be authorized for a distinct
   subset of the network-provided resolvers.

   A zone is termed a "Validated Split-Horizon zone" after successful
   validation using a "tamperproof" NS resolution method, i.e. a method
   that is not subject to interference by the local network operator.
   Two possible tamperproof resolution methods are presented below.

6.1.  Using Pre-configured Public Resolver

   The client sends the NS query to a pre-configured resolver that is
   external to the network, over a secure transport.  Clients SHOULD
   apply whatever acceptance rules they would otherwise apply when using
   this resolver (e.g. checking the AD bit, validating RRSIGs).

6.2.  Using DNSSEC

   The client resolves the NS record using any resolution method of its
   choice (e.g. querying one of the network-provided resolvers,
   performing iterative resolution locally), and performs full DNSSEC
   validation locally [RFC6698].  The result is processed based on its
   DNSSEC validation state (Section 4.3 of [RFC4035]):

   Secure:  the response is used for validation.

   Bogus or Indeterminate:  the response is rejected and validation is
      considered to have failed.

   Insecure:  the client SHOULD retry the validation process using a
      different method, such as the one in Section 6.1, to ensure
      compatibility with unsigned names.

7.  Examples of Split-Horizon DNS Configuration

   Two examples are shown below.  The first example showing an company
   with an internal-only DNS server resolving the entire zone for that
   company (e.g., *.example.com) the second example resolving only a
   subdomain of the company's zone (e.g., *.internal.example.com).

7.1.  Split-Horizon Entire Zone

   Consider an organization that operates "example.com", and runs a
   different version of its global domain on its internal network.
   Today, on the Internet it publishes two NS records, "ns1.example.com"
   and "ns2.example.com".

   The host and network first need mutual support one of the mechanisms
   described in learning (Section 4).  Shown in Figure 1 is learning
   using DNR and PvD.

   Validation is then perfomed using either Public DNS (Section 7.1.1)
   or DNSSEC (Section 7.1.2).

   steps 1-2:  The client determines the network's DNS server
      (ns1.example.com) and Provisioning Domain (pvd.example.com) using
      DNR [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] and PvD [RFC8801], using one of DNR Router
      Solicitation, DHCPv4, or DHCPv6.

   step 3-5:  The client connects to the DNR-learned DNS server
      (ns1.example.com), validates its certificate, and queries for
      pvd.example.com.

   steps 6-7:  The client connects to the PvD server, validates its
      certificate, and retrieves the provisioning domain JSON
      information indicated by the associated PvD.  The PvD contains:

    {
       "identifier": "pvd.example.com",
       "expires": "2020-05-23T06:00:00Z",
       "prefixes": ["2001:db8:1::/48", "2001:db8:4::/48"],
       "dnsZones:": ["example.com"]
     }

      The JSON keys "identifier", "expires", and "prefixes" are defined
      in [RFC8801].

      dnsZones.  The NS lookup for "example.com" will return
      "ns1.example.com" and "ns2.example.com".

   Step 3:  As the network-provided nameservers are the same as the
      names retrieved from the public resolver and the network-
      designated resolver's certificate includes at least one of the
      names retrieved from the public resolver, the client has finished
      validation that the nameservers signaled in [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] and
      [RFC8801] are owned and managed by the same entity that published
      the NS records on the Internet.  The endpoint will then use that
      information from [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] and [RFC8801] to resolve names
      within dnsZones.

7.1.2.  Verification using DNSSEC

   The figure below shows the steps performed to verify the local claims
   of DNS authority using DNSSEC.

   Steps 1-2:  The DNSSEC-validating client queries the network
      encrypted resolver to issue NS queries for the domains in
      dnsZones.  The NS lookup for "example.com" will return a signed
      response containing "ns1.example.com" and "ns2.example.com".  The
      client then performs full DNSSEC validation locally.

   Step 3:  As the DNSSEC validation is successful and the network-
      provided nameservers are the same as the names in the DNSSEC
      response, and the network-designated resolver's certificate
      includes at least one of the names returned in the DNSSEC
      response, the client has finished validation that the nameservers
      signaled in [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] and [RFC8801] are owned and managed
      by the same entity that published the NS records on the Internet.
      The endpoint will then use that information from
      [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] and [RFC8801] to resolve names within dnsZones.

7.2.  Split-Horizon Only Subdomain of Zone

   A subdomain can also be used for all internal DNS names (e.g., the
   zone internal.example.com exists only on the internal DNS server).
   For successful validation described in this document the the internal




Reddy, et al.           Expires October 14, 2022               [Page 11]

   DNS server will need a certificate signed by a CA trusted by the
   client.

   For such a name internal.example.com the message flow is similar to
   Section 7.1 the difference is that queries for hosts not within the
   subdomain (www.example.com) are sent to the public resolver rather
   than resolver for internal.example.com.

8.  Validation with IKEv2

   When the VPN tunnel is IPsec, the encrypted DNS resolver hosted by
   the VPN service provider can be securely discovered by the endpoint
   using the ENCDNS_IP*_* IKEv2 Configuration Payload Attribute Types
   defined in [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-add-ike].

   Other VPN tunnel types have similar configuration capabilities, not
   detailed here.

9.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not alter DNSSEC validation behaviour.  To
   ensure compatibility with validating clients, network operators MUST
   ensure that names under the split-horizon are correctly signed or
   place them in an unsigned zone.

   If an internal zone name (e.g., internal.example.com) is used with in
   conjunction with this specification and a public certificate is
   obtained for validation, that internal zone name will exist in
   Certificate Transparency [RFC9162] logs.  It should be noted,
   however, that this specification does not leak individual host names
   (e.g., www.internal.example.com) into the Certificate Transparancy
   logs or to public DNS resolvers.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
