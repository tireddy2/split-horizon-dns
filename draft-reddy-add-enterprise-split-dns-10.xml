    <abstract>
      <t>When split-horizon DNS is deployed by a network, certain domains can
      be resolved authoritatively by the network-provided DNS resolver. DNS
      clients that don't always use this resolver might wish to do so for
      these domains. This specification describes how clients
      can confirm the local resolver's authority over these 
      domains.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>To resolve a DNS query, there are three essential behaviors that an
      implementation can apply: (1) answer from a local database, (2) query
      the relevant authorities and their parents, or (3) ask a server to query
      those authorities and return the final answer. Implementations that use
      these behaviors are called "authoritative nameservers", "full
      resolvers", and "forwarders" (or "stub resolvers"). However, an
      implementation can also implement a mixture of these behaviors,
      depending on a local policy, for each query. We term such an
      implementation a "hybrid resolver".</t>

      <t>Most DNS resolvers are hybrids of some kind. For example, stub
      resolvers frequently support a local "hosts file" that preempts query
      forwarding, and most DNS forwarders and full resolvers can also serve
      responses from a local zone file. Other standardized hybrid resolution
      behaviors include Local Root <xref target="RFC8806"></xref>, mDNS <xref
      target="RFC6762"></xref>, and NXDOMAIN synthesis for .onion <xref
      target="RFC7686"></xref>.</t>

      <t>In many network environments, the network offers clients a DNS server
      (e.g. DHCP OFFER, IPv6 Router Advertisement). Although this server is
      formally specified as a recursive resolver (e.g. Section 5.1 of <xref
      target="RFC6106"></xref>), some networks provide a hybrid resolver
      instead. If this resolver acts as an authoritative server for some
      names, we say that the network has "split-horizon DNS", because those
      names resolve in this way only from inside the network.</t>

      <t>Network clients that use pure stub resolution, sending all queries to
      the network-provided resolver, will always receive the split-horizon
      results. Conversely, clients that send all queries to a different
      resolver or implement pure full resolution locally will never receive
      them. Clients with either pure resolution behavior are out of scope for
      this specification. Instead, this specification enables hybrid clients
      to access split-horizon results from a network-provided hybrid resolver,
      while using a different resolution method for some or all other
      names.</t>

      <t>To achieve the required security properties, clients must be able to
      authenticate the DNS servers provided by the network, for example using
      the techniques proposed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-add-dnr"></xref> and
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-add-ddr"></xref>, and prove that they are
      authorized to serve the offered split-horizon DNS names. As a result,
      use of this specification is limited to servers that support
      authenticated encryption and split-horizon DNS names that are properly
      rooted in the global DNS.</t>

    <section anchor="notation" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
      <xref target="RFC2119"></xref><xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

      <t>This document makes use of the terms defined in <xref
      target="RFC8499"></xref>. The term "Global DNS" is defined in
      <xref target="RFC8499"></xref>.</t>

      <t>'Encrypted DNS' refers to a DNS protocol that provides an encrypted
      channel between a DNS client and server (e.g., DoT, DoH, or DoQ).</t>

      <t>The terms 'Validated Split-Horizon' and 'Domain Camping' are also
      defined.</t>

      <section title="Validated Split-Horizon">
        <t>A split horizon configuration for some name is considered
        "validated" if any parent of that name has given the local network
        permission to serve its own responses for that name. Such
        validation generally extend to the entire subtree of names below
        the authorization point.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Domain Camping">
        <t>Domain Camping refers to operating a nameserver which claims to be
        authoritative for a zone, but actually isn't. For example, a domain
        called example.com on the Internet and an internal DNS server also
        claims to be authoritative for example.com, but has no delegation from
        example.com on the Internet. Someone might domain camp on a popular
        domain name providing the ability to monitor queries and modify
        answers for that domain.</t>

        <t>A common variation on domain camping is "NXDOMAIN camping", in
        which a nameserver claims a zone that does not exist in the global
        DNS. This is a form of domain camping because it seizes a portion of
        the parent zone without permission. The use of nonexistent TLDs for
        local services is a form of NXDOMAIN camping on the root zone.</t>

        <t>Any form of domain camping likely violates the IAB's guidance
        regarding "the Unique DNS Root" <xref target="RFC2826"></xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Scope">
      <t>The protocol in this document allows the domain owner to
      create a split-horizon DNS.  Other entities which do not own the
      domain are detected by the client.  Thus, DNS filtering is not
      enabled by this protocol.</t>
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="learning" title="Learning Local Claims of DNS Authority">

      <t>As a first step, the host joins a network and determines if that
      network contains a local DNS server which claims authority over a
      zone.  Two methods of performing that function are described below,
      host configuration and provisioning domains.</t>


    <section anchor="hostconfig" title="Host Configuration">
    <t>A host can be configured with DNS information when it joins a 
    network, including when it brings up VPN (which is also considered
    joining a(n additional) network, detailed in <xref target="vpn"/>).  Existing implementations determine
    the host has joined a certain network via SSID, IP subnet assigned,
    DNS server IP address or name, and other similar mechanisms. For
    example, one existing implementation determines the host has joined
    an internal network because the DHCP-assigned IP address belongs to the 
    company's IP address (as assigned by the regional IP addressing authority)
    and the DHCP-advertised DNS IP address is one used by IT at that
    network.  Other mechanisms exist in other products but are not
    interesting to this specification; rather what is interesting is this
    step to determine "we have joined the internal corporate network" occurred
    and the DNS server is configured as authoritative for certain DNS zones
    (e.g., *.example.com).</t>
    <t>Because a rogue network can simulate all or most of 
    the above characteristics this specification details how to validate these claims
    in <xref target="validating"></xref>.</t>
    </section>


    <section anchor="dnsZones" title="Provisioning Domains dnsZones">
      <t>Provisioning Domains (PvDs) are defined in <xref
      target="RFC7556"></xref> as sets of network configuration information
      that clients can use to access networks, including rules for DNS
      resolution and proxy configuration. The PvD Key dnsZones is defined in
      <xref target="RFC8801"></xref>. The PvD Key dnsZones notifies clients of
      names for which one of the network-provided resolvers is authoritative.
      Attempting to resolve these names via another resolver might fail or
      return results that are not correct for this network.</t>

      <t>Each dnsZones entry indicates a claim of authority over a domain and
      its subdomains. For example, if the dnsZones entry is "example.test",
      this covers "example.test", "www.example.test", and
      "mail.eng.example.test", but not "otherexample.test" or
      "example.test.net".</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC8801"></xref> defines a mechanism for discovering
      multiple Explicit PvDs on a single network and their Additional
      Information by means of an HTTP-over-TLS query using a URI derived from
      the PvD ID. This set of additional configuration information is referred
      to as a Web Provisioning Domain (Web PvD). The PvD RA option defined in
      <xref target="RFC8801"></xref> SHOULD set the H-flag to indicate that
      Additional Information is available. This Additional Information JSON
      object SHOULD include the "dnsZones" key to define the DNS domains for
      which the network claims authority.</t>

<section title="Split-Horizon Only Subdomain of Zone">
  <t>A subdomain can also be used for all internal DNS names
  (e.g., the zone internal.example.com exists only on the internal DNS
  server).  For successful validation described in this document the
  the internal DNS server will need a certificate signed by a CA trusted
  by the client.  If a publicly-signed certificate is used, this means
  the internal zone name will exist in
  <xref target="RFC9162">Certificate Transparancy</xref> logs.  However,
  individual host names   (e.g., www.internal.example.com) will not be listed in Certificate Transparancy
  logs for the validation described in this document.</t>

  <t>For such a name internal.example.com the message flows work
  identically as with <xref target="internal-only"></xref>, the only
  difference that queries for example.com (e.g., www.example.com)
  which are not within internal.example.com are sent to the normal
  resolver rather than to the internal resolver.</t>

    <section anchor="vpn" title="Split-Horizon DNS Configuration for IKEv2">
      <t>The split-tunnel Virtual Private Network (VPN) configuration allows
      the endpoint to access resources that reside in the VPN <xref
      target="RFC8598"></xref> via the tunnel; other traffic not destined to
      the VPN does not traverse the tunnel. In contrast, a non-split-tunnel
      VPN configuration causes all traffic to traverse the tunnel into the
      VPN.</t>

      <t>When the VPN tunnel is IPsec, the encrypted DNS resolver hosted by
      the VPN service provider can be securely discovered by the endpoint
      using the ENCDNS_IP*_* IKEv2 Configuration Payload Attribute Types
      defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ipsecme-add-ike"></xref>. For
      split-tunnel VPN configurations, the endpoint uses the discovered
      encrypted DNS server to resolve domain names for which the VPN provider
      claims authority. For non-split-tunnel VPN configurations, the endpoint
      uses the discovered encrypted DNS server to resolve both global and
      private domain names. For split-tunnel VPN configurations, the IKE
      client can use any one of the mechanisms discussed in <xref
      target="validating"></xref> to determine if the VPN service provider is
      authoritative over the Split-Horizon DNS domains.</t>

      <t>Other VPN tunnel types have similar configuration capabilities, not
      detailed here.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>When using dnsZones (<xref target="dnsZones"/>) the content of dnsZones may be passed to another (DNS) program for
      processing. As with any network input, the content SHOULD be considered
      untrusted and handled accordingly. The client must perform the
      mechanisms discussed in <xref target="validating"></xref> to determine if
      the network-designated encrypted resolvers are authoritative over the
      domains in dnsZones. If they are not, the client must ignore those
      dnsZones.</t>

      <t>This specification does not alter DNSSEC validation behaviour. To
      ensure compatibility with validating clients, network operators MUST
      ensure that names under the split-horizon are correctly signed or place
      them in an unsigned zone.</t>
